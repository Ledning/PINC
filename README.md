# PINC
PINC Is Not Cower!

PINC is an AUR helper inspired by the abandoned helper Cower's simple and light command syntax with a clear distinction between
the official repositories and AUR packages. PINC also features automatization for AUR package building.

## Command line examples

**Check for updates**

`pinc -u`

**Download package**

`pinc -d package_name`

**Update, download and build all outdated packages**

`pinc -udr`

**Other**

For more commands, run `pinc -h`.

## Install

To install pinc, clone the repository to a place you like and make a symbolic link to the pinc binary.

`sudo ln -s /home/username/PINC/pinc.py /usr/bin/pinc`

In the future PINC will be available on AUR.
